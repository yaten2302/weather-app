# Weather App

The weather app is an application that shows the current weather details for a given location. Users can get weather data either by searching the name of the place or by getting their own location.

# Api Keys

To work on this project, you have to make sure to get your own api key using the "openweathermap api" and the "reverse geocoding api" to display the user's current location.
